# DungeonsnDragons_ProjectOOP
A 2D dnd style game to test and implement OOP principles.

The project is attempting to create a 2D game that is similar to Dungeons and Dragons. 
The game will be a turn based game where the player will be able to move around a map and interact with objects and enemies. 
The game will be created using the logic and the JFrame library.
In the project we will attempt to implement the following OOP principles:
- Inheritance - The units in the game will be created using inheritance.
- Polymorphism - The units will interact with each other using polymorphism.
- Abstraction - The units will be created using abstraction -
- Encapsulation - The information the units will have will be encapsulated.
- Composition - The units will be composed of different objects.
- Aggregation - The units will be aggregated to the map.
- Association - The units will be associated with each other using interactions and design patterns.
- Delegation - The interactions will be delegated to the units they interact with.
- Dependency - The units will be dependent on the map and the map will be dependent on the units.
- Coupling - The units will be coupled to the map so they can interact with other units and tiles.
