This package was unfortunately not used to make the game UI correctly.
The game UI was made on the fly as we were trying to understand the elements building it.
Time spent on understanding the functionality of the package caused us to miss the coupling and cohesion of the
UI elements.
This caused us to have a very hard time to make the UI elements work together.
We ended up with a lot of code that was not used and a lot of code that was not working - teaching a valuable lesson
about the importance of planning and understanding the code before writing it.
