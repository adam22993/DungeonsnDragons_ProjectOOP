The same as with the gameUI issue mentioned there... although we are not sure if this is the same issue,
the controls are integrated into the controlLayer, causing coupling between the two. This is not good.
After the semester we are planning to redo the project - first in Java with Swing, and then in C++ in the Godot engine!
